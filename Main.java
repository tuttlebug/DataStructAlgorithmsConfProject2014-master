   * 
   * - import (preferably all of) the relevant libraries (this means imports will need to be deleted
   * from other files later)
   * 
   * - Instantiate all variables required for the game to commence. 
   * 
   * Possible structure for instantiation (bottom to top):
   *  - JLayeredPane for Worlds-Level:
   *    - Create instances of each world, with their associated variables (Carriables, NPCs, buildings, boundaries)
   *    - Load associated images (with each world, or one at a time?)
   *    - Instances of monsters, NPCs
   *  - JLayeredPane for Tome-Level: 
   *    - Tome's character object, character sprites, etc. 
   *    - Instance of HP bar
   *    - Instance of companion (load images, etc., but don't load right away)
   *  - JLayeredPane for dialogue:
   *    - Creation of the JLayeredPane for dialogue
   *    - Creation of the area in the JLayeredPane that will show dialogue
   *    - Instances of all dialogue (unless this comes to be loaded under NPCs?)
   *  - JLayeredPane for the menu:
   *    - Instance of Pack class, to store Carriable items picked up by the player.
   *    - Instance of Pack icon
   *
